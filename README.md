## Overview

docext is an OCR-free tool for extracting structured information from documents such as invoices, passports, and other documents. It leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to accurately identify and extract both field data and tabular information from document images.

The [Intelligent Document Processing Leaderboard](https://idp-leaderboard.org/) tracks and evaluates performance vision-language models across OCR, Key Information Extraction (KIE), document classification, table extraction, and other intelligent document processing tasks.


## Features
### Intelligent Document Processing Leaderboard
This benchmark evaluates performance across seven key document intelligence challenges:

- **Key Information Extraction (KIE)**: Extract structured fields from unstructured document text.
- **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**: Assess understanding of document content via question-answering.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Measure accuracy in recognizing printed and handwritten text.
- **Document Classification**: Evaluate how accurately models categorize various document types.
- **Long Document Processing**: Test models' reasoning over lengthy, context-rich documents.
- **Table Extraction**: Benchmark structured data extraction from complex tabular formats.
- **Confidence Score Calibration**: Evaluate the reliability and confidence of model predictions.

🔍 For in-depth information, see the [release blog](https://github.com/NanoNets/docext/tree/main/docext/benchmark).

📊 **Live leaderboard:** [https://idp-leaderboard.org](https://idp-leaderboard.org)
